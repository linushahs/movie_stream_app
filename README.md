# Peamon-movie-app
Peamon is a web application that allows users to search and discover movies. The app utilizes the power of the React.js library for building reusable UI components and efficient updates to the user interface, and the TMDB API for fetching movie data, including information about popular and upcoming movies, as well as reviews, ratings, and trailers.
